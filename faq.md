<a id="how-do-i-create-new-entries">
### How do I create new entries?

When you are logged into your Firefox Account on Firefox for desktop or mobile, every time you enter new login information, Firefox will prompt you to save these details. Your login information will then sync to Firefox Lockbox.

<a id="how-do-i-edit-existing-entries">
### How do I edit existing entries?

You’ll need to edit entries in Firefox. To do this in Firefox for desktop, go to Settings/Preferences, and under the Privacy & Security panel, select the Saved Logins button. Double click on entry information to edit.

To edit entries on Firefox for iOS or Firefox for Android, go to settings and select the Logins menu under the Privacy section.

<a id="what-security-technology-does-firefox-lockbox-use">
### What security technologies does Firefox Lockbox use?

Firefox Lockbox uses the following technologies to protect your data:

* [AES-256-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) encryption, a tamper-resistant block cipher technology.
* [onepw](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/wiki/onepw-protocol) protocol to sign into Firefox Accounts and obtain encryption keys.
* [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) and [HKDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF) with [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) to create the encryption key from your Firefox Accounts username and password.

All of this is done on your device, so Mozilla cannot know your password and cannot read your data.
